/*
 *      Change the game to follow these rules:
 *
 *      1. A Player looses his Entire SCORE when he rolls two  6 in a row. After that, it's the
 *      next player's turn. (Hint: Always save the previous dice roll in a separate variable.)
 *
 *      2. Add an input field to the HTML where players can set the winning score, so that
 *      they can change predefined score of 100, (Hint: you can read that value with the .value
 *      property in javascript.)
 *
 *      3. Add another dice to the game, so that there are two dices now. The player looses his
 *      current score when one of them is 1. (Hint: you will need CSS to position the second dice,
 *      so take a look at the CSS code for the first one.)
